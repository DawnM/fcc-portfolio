        <p>Here is a repl.it frame in which you can run the raw python version of a quiz I am building.  Click the green play button at the top and answer the questions as they appear in the black pane.</p>
        <p>You should get 2 chances for each question.</p>
        <p>This project is currently on hold while I focus on freelance work, but please feel free to send me any feedback via the main <a href="#show-contact">contact form</a>.</p>
